#Introduction
Create Interactive CLI app with Kotlin
I will demonstrate building a simple command line application using Kotlin 

So I have been inspired by this guy theapache aka shrief, he has been building lots of great tools using bash scripts, looking the things he he building also gives me peter tingle to develop things of my own, but sadly Iâ€™m not bash master, so I decided to learn it and automate some of my stuff, but looking  youtube and learning from docs specially something other than Kotlin, I feel is a waste of my brain juice #fanBOY , and I donâ€™t know Hardest part for me is not the code but the setting of developement enviorment and dependencies. After bit of zoozling I figure got to know  Kotlin has scripting support too ðŸ¤© and I got excited to dig inâ€¦ but `Khoda pahad nikla chua` #disappointmentâ€¦ apparently you can make scripts with Kts extensions and needs kotlinc command to run these scripts and I didnâ€™t know how to export them into bash file and package itâ€™s dependencies. 

Reading docs figure that KEEP has proposal for Scripting support but havenâ€™t yet made progress with it proposal docs here. So since first party support was out I looking up medium for 3rd party framework that could help me do that. I ended up with KScript and some KotlinConf talks on it. 

It is a whole some framework for scripting but.. I wasnâ€™t able to grasp it. It required me to install Kscript
